You can use either standalone executables or pure python script (script runs faster)

To run standalone executable you need to install:
1.Calibre

Now you can use executables/wisecreator.exe or (if you use Linux) executables/wisecreator.
You can copy those files anywhere you like on your computer

How to use:
    Windows:
    wisecreator.exe PATH_TO_YOUR_MOBI_BOOK
    Linux:
    ./wisecreator PATH_TO_YOUR_MOBI_BOOK

To run the script you need to install:
1.Python3
2.Python libs:
    NLTK: http://www.nltk.org/
    sqlite3
3.calibre (console utility "ebook-convert" is used inside the script)

Now you can run wisecreator:
    ./main.py PATH_TO_YOUR_MOBI_BOOK
